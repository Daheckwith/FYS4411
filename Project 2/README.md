# A restricted Boltzmann Machinne coupled with variational Monte-Carlo

Restricted Boltzmann machine as a way of defining the trial wave function of a system of two electrons in a harmonic oscillator trap. Coupled with variational Monte-Carlo and gradient descent to optimize the variational parameters and arrive at an estimate for the ground state energy of the system. The article can be found in the subfolder named **Article**.

## Running the programs
The main python files are `main.py`, `gradientDescent.py` and `hiddenNodes.py`. They're made respectively to test any preset, how the gradient descent schemes behave and how the RBM's results are affected by the number of hidden nodes.
